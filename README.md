# vortex-assistant-ai

This is my [vortex](https://github.com/vortex-hue) Artificial Intelligence Bot, built open source libraries like [openai](https://platform.openai.com) and [streamlit](https://streamlit.io)

[Strealit Docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/tutorials/build-conversational-apps)

## Features
 The chatapp references and takes some features from chatgpt, also makes use of gpt3.5 turbo and lots of amazing features including chat history

 - It's fully built in python, no css, html, or javascript, just only python in less than 50 lines of actual codes


 ### Web link
